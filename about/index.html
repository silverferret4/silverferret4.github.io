    <b>About this site:</b>  
    <p>Like many developers, I have a wide range of interests that extend beyond code.  From art, to literature to programming, sometimes it gets a little difficult to keep track everything I am playing around with.</p>
    <p>That's why I decided to move to GitHub: I can organize and store all of my projects in one location, and with GitHub pages can assemble one entry point that higlights all of the different things I am working on.</p>
    <p>While the site might change over time, the initial intent is to maintain a list of the projects I am working on, support an occassional blog post and provide an easier way for me to document what it is that I am doing and why.  The fact that it is public is also a big plus.</p>
