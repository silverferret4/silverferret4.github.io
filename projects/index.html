    <p>
    This is the code for the GitHub page you are currently viewing.  The concept is simple, clean, and just meant to be a 
    convenient way for me to organize and store the different projects that I am working on.

    <p>
    Technology choice is very simple; I use Jekyll along with some basic HTML and CSS.

    <a href="https://github.com/silverferret4/benetten.com">benetten.com - Art Site</a>
    <p>
    Project for my art site.  After years of working with a CMS, I woke up
    one morning and realized that was overkill, and decided to build it with a simpler technology stack.

    <p>
    A work in progress, Simple Log is meant to be an easy to use, web-based utility that allows you to track anything
    you want in a truly customizable manner.  From reading lists to workouts, you can create a log that tracks exactly
    the attributes you care about, even setting motiviational challenges to help you reach your desired goals.

    Built with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and a little javascript.
