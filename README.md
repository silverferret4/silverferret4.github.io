# silverferret4.github.io
This repo is setup to support my [GitHub](http://github.com) - Pages main page: [silverferret4.github.io](http://silverferret4.github.io).  

While almost completely undefined at this point in all aspects (scope, technology choices, even subject matter) I do know that I want someplace where I can do the following:

* Write an occassional blog post
* List projects I am working on
* Have a way to track those projects (enhancement and bug fixes)
* Have a way to document those projects

The last two items in this list are really what drew me to GitHub in the first place.  I work on technical projects very sporadically, so if I have a period where I am brainstorming or working, I need to be able to get those ideas down quickly and in a way that when I come back weeks later I know where to pick up.  I also want to be able to more easily document what I am doing and why.  So, GitHub.

Finding [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) when I got here made me reevaluate a lot, and I realize that for the most part I do not need a full CMS for anything that I do.  So, my first project on GitHub that I will document, add issues to, etc. will be getting my GitHub page setup with Jekyll.
